        "text": "Hi HN! Today I&#x27;m launching OpenTimes, a free database of roughly 150 billion pre-computed, point-to-point travel times between United States Census geographies. In addition to letting you visualize travel isochrones on the homepage, OpenTimes also lets you download massive amounts of travel time data for free and with no limits.<p>The primary goal here is to enable research and fill a gap I noticed in the open-source spatial ecosystem. Researchers (social scientists, economists, etc.) use large travel time matrices to quantify things like access to healthcare, but they often end up paying Google or Esri for the necessary data. By pre-calculating times between commonly-used research geographies (i.e. Census) and then making those times easily accessible via SQL, I hope to make large-scale accessibility research cheaper and simpler.<p>Some technical bits that may be of interest to HN folks:<p>- The entire OpenTimes backend is just static Parquet files on R2. There&#x27;s no RDBMS or running service. The whole thing costs about $10&#x2F;month to host and is free to serve.<p>- All travel times were calculated by pre-building the inputs (OSM, OSRM networks) and then distributing the compute over hundreds of GitHub Actions jobs.<p>- The query&#x2F;SQL layer uses a setup I haven&#x27;t seen before: a single DuckDB database file with views that point to static Parquet files via HTTP.<p>Finally, the driving times are optimistic since they don&#x27;t (yet) account for traffic. This is something I hope to work on in the near future. Enjoy!",

No API keys, no setup—just paste a link and see the preview.<p>Why I built this\nI often ran into issues where social platforms displayed broken or unexpected link previews. Debugging Open Graph meta tags was annoying, so I made a tool to make it easier.<p>How it works\nFetches metadata from any URL\nParses Open Graph &amp; Twitter Card tags\nShows real-time previews of how the link will look when shared<p>Try it out: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metacheck.appstate.co&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metacheck.appstate.co&#x2F;</a>",

That said, I&#x27;m curious to hear what ML researchers think about Lecun&#x27;s take, and if there&#x27;s any engineering done around it.

I&#x27;m an avid cyclist who took the leap a few months ago to quit my job and focus 100% on building VeloPlanner – a tool I wished existed for my own cycling adventures.<p>VeloPlanner helps cyclists plan routes by prioritizing official, signposted cycling paths across Europe, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.<p>What makes this different:<p>- Focus on official cycling routes rather than just shortest path algorithms\n- Comprehensive POI integration (campings, hotels, attractions)\n- Detailed surface information (asphalt, gravel, forest trails)<p>This is a solo founder project that I&#x27;m now working on full-time after validating the initial concept. The decision to leave my job wasn&#x27;t easy, but the enthusiastic response from early users convinced me it was worth the risk. It&#x27;s still early days so hard to tell if that will pay off :)<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts and feedback!",

I&#x27;m very interested in decomposing audio signals into a description of the &quot;system&quot; (e.g., room, instrument, vocal tract, etc.) and a sparse &quot;control signal&quot; which describes how and when energy is injected into that system.  This toy was a great way to start learning about physical modeling synthesis, which seems to be the next stop in my research journey.  I was also pleasantly surprised at what&#x27;s possible these days writing custom Audio Worklets!",

You have to guess where you are in time and on the map. It’s like GeoGuessr (and heavily inspired by it!) but for historical events.<p>The videos are all created with AI. It’s a pipeline of Flux (images), Kling (video), and mmaudio (audio). The videos aren’t always historically accurate to the last detail. They might incorporate elements of folklore or have details from popular beliefs about the way things looked rather than the latest academic research on how they looked.<p>I’m thinking a lot about how to make the game more interactive. One thing that makes Geoguessr so fun for me is that you can move infinitely and always find more details to help you pinpoint the location. I want Time Portal to have a similar quality. I have a few ideas to try soon that will hopefully make the game more interactive and infinite.",

Here’s a demo video: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uQ-TTdiu3fc&amp;t=20s\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uQ-TTdiu3fc&amp;t=20s</a>, and there&#x27;s a demo playground you can try out here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.trysift.dev&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.trysift.dev&#x2F;</a>.<p>We used to work on product and engineering at Datadog and Splunk. We saw how even teams using these industry-leading tools were struggling to effectively interpret and use their logging data. The sheer volume of logs overwhelmed experts and newcomers alike, making it difficult to quickly identify meaningful issues or patterns. Despite powerful indexing and search capabilities, developers still had to manually piece together context from different logs, dashboards, and sources—a tedious and error-prone process.<p>The “noisy logging” problem—that is, the gap between overwhelming amounts of raw log data and insights people can act on—ultimately is a gap between machines (which generate all this data) and humans (who want and need the insights). SiftDev is built to bridge that gap and to automate the tedious, manual aspects of debugging and observability. In marketing-speak: “humans should never have to look at a log again!” We think people should interact with their data in terms that make sense on a human level.<p>What makes SiftDev different is its understanding of application context over time. While traditional tooling typically lets developers analyze logs in isolation, or with minimal surrounding context, SiftDev builds comprehensive profiles of your application&#x27;s normal behavior patterns. This awareness allows us to understand what&#x27;s truly abnormal versus what might appear unusual in a single snapshot but is actually expected behavior for your specific application.\nSiftDev applies semantic analysis and profiling to understand your application&#x27;s logging behavior holistically. Instead of relying solely on manual search, Sift identifies core application processes, automatically detects patterns, and surfaces anomalies, including clear explanations and context.<p>Here are some examples of what this can look like in practice:\nIdentify core processes: SiftDev instantly recognizes your payment workflows—like authorization, capture, and refunds—without manual tagging.\nDetect performance patterns: SiftDev learns your nightly batch job typically handles 10,000 records in 45 minutes, establishing a clear baseline.\nSurface hidden anomalies: SiftDev flags silent failures, such as two microservices updating the same record within 50ms—issues normally hidden by routine logs.<p>You can then directly ask your logs questions like, “What&#x27;s causing errors in our checkout service?” or “Why did latency spike at 2 AM?” and immediately receive insightful, actionable answers that you’d otherwise manually be searching for.<p>We’d love for you to test out our product via our demo playground at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.trysift.dev&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.trysift.dev&#x2F;</a>! It’s a slightly less functional version of our platform but shares a lot of the core features. Note: we do need users to sign up to do this but waitlist is optional (of course).<p>We&#x27;d love your feedback, thoughts, and experiences dealing with logging and observability challenges!",

It uses your phone&#x27;s camera to capture WiFi details (network name and password) from printed text, then generates a QR code right on your screen. You can instantly connect using Google Circle to Search or Google Lens. You can also import an image from your gallery instead of using the camera.<p>Currently, it&#x27;s Android-only since I daily-drive a Pixel 7, and WiFi APIs differ significantly between Android and iOS.\nPlay Store link: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.yilinjuang.wify\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.yilinjuang...</a><p>I&#x27;d appreciate your feedback or suggestions!",

You have to use another LLM on top of it to get the final result. Some VLM’s directly give structured information like key fields from documents like invoices, but you have to either add business rules on top of it or use some LLM as a judge kind of system to get sense of which output needs to be manually reviewed or can be taken as correct output. No benchmark attempts to measure the actual rate of automation you can achieve.<p>We have tried to solve this problem with a benchmark that is only applicable for documents&#x2F;usecases where you are looking for automation and its trying to measure that end to end automation level of different models or systems.<p>We have collected a dataset that represents documents like invoices etc which are applicable in processes where automation is needed vs are more copilot in nature where you would need to chat with document.

        "text": "I&#x27;m Jack, and I&#x27;m excited to share a project that has channeled my Factorio addiction recently: the Factorio Learning Environment (FLE).<p>FLE is an open-source framework for developing and evaluating LLM agents in Factorio. It provides a controlled environment where AI models can attempt complex automation, resource management, and optimisation tasks in a grounded world with meaningful constraints.<p>A critical advantage of Factorio as a benchmark is its unbounded nature. Unlike many evals that are quickly saturated by newer models, Factorio&#x27;s geometric complexity scaling means it won&#x27;t be &quot;solved&quot; in the next 6 months (or possibly even years). This allows us to meaningfully compare models by the order-of-magnitude of resources they can produce - creating a benchmark with longevity.<p>The project began 18 months ago after years of playing Factorio, recognising its potential as an AI research testbed. A few months ago, our team (myself, Akbir, and Mart) came together to create a benchmark that tests agent capabilities in spatial reasoning and long-term planning.<p>Two technical innovations drove this project forward: First, we discovered that piping Lua into the Factorio console over TCP enables running (almost) arbitrary code without directly modding the game. Second, we developed a first-class Python API that wraps these Lua programs to provide a clean, type-hinted interface for AI agents to interact with Factorio through familiar programming paradigms.<p>Agents interact with FLE through a REPL pattern:\n1. They observe the world (seeing the output of their last action)\n2. Generate Python code to perform their next action\n3. Receive detailed feedback (including exceptions and stdout)<p>We provide two main evaluation settings:\n- Lab-play: 24 structured tasks with fixed resources\n- Open-play: An unbounded task of building the largest possible factory on a procedurally generated map<p>We found that while LLMs show promising short-horizon skills, they struggle with spatial reasoning in constrained environments. They can discover basic automation strategies (like electric-powered drilling) but fail to achieve more complex automation (like electronic circuit manufacturing). Claude Sonnet 3.5 is currently the best model (by a significant margin).<p>The code is available at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JackHopkins&#x2F;factorio-learning-environment\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JackHopkins&#x2F;factorio-learning-environment</a>.<p>You&#x27;ll need:\n- Factorio (version 1.1.110)\n- Docker\n- Python 3.10+<p>The README contains detailed installation instructions and examples of how to run evaluations with different LLM agents.<p>We would love to hear your thoughts and see what others can do with this framework!",

Basically a &quot;create once, ship everywhere&quot; concept.<p>Things will get more interesting as I incorporate stuff like spell check (for speech) and abstract syntax tree checking (for code), so you can quite literally check the validity of your software course in realtime as you build the course.<p>You can read more about the technical details and history on my Substack launch post:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codevideo.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;launching-codevideo-after-two-years\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codevideo.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;launching-codevideo-after-t...</a><p>And here&#x27;s the intro video about how to use the studio:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;4nyuhWF6SS0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;4nyuhWF6SS0</a><p>EDIT: added link to the mp4 created in the demo video:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coffee-app.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com&#x2F;codevideo&#x2F;v3&#x2F;a5edf4e4-c512-4b62-b7f9-11dbe689440e.mp4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coffee-app.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com&#x2F;codevideo...</a><p>From an intellectual and software standpoint this product has been (and still is) an absolute blast to build - and as always, I&#x27;ve learned a TON along the way. Very excited to get feedback from the Hacker community - even (maybe especially?) the classic skeptical feedback ;)<p>As an engineer, I always suck at monetization and things like that - I already am wondering if the whole token system is too complex and perhaps a different model would be better. Again, waiting for feedback from everyone. Until then, enjoy the studio!",

Keeping your personal information private.<p>My name is Lanedirt and I’m a software developer with over 15 years of experience and a privacy enthusiast. Since 2013, I&#x27;ve been running a public temporary email service (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spamok.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spamok.com</a>), but I wanted to build something more privacy-centric and fully self-hostable. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve spent the last year developing AliasVault from scratch. The idea behind AliasVault is simple: create unique, random identities for every website, protecting your privacy and reducing online tracking and profiling.<p>Key Features:<p>- Unique identities &amp; passwords: Generate individual aliases and strong passwords for every site.<p>- Built-in email server: Create email aliases with your own domains, receive and read emails directly in AliasVault—no external dependencies.<p>- Zero-knowledge encryption: All data encrypted locally (using Argon2Id and AES-256-GCM); your master password never leaves your device.<p>- Flexible installation: Docker-based self-hosting, supports Linux VMs and ARM devices (like Raspberry Pi).<p>- Fully Open-source: Free to use, audit, modify, under the MIT license.<p>I&#x27;ve just released v0.14.0, which adds:<p>- Built-in support for Google Authenticator-compatible TOTP code generation.<p>- Official browser extensions now approved and live in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari (macOS), and Brave app stores for easy access to your credentials, email aliases and allows for one-click alias creation.<p>Try the official supported cloud version: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aliasvault.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aliasvault.net</a><p>Github and quick self install guide: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lanedirt&#x2F;AliasVault\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lanedirt&#x2F;AliasVault</a><p>Full documentation including architecture: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aliasvault.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aliasvault.net</a><p>I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback and suggestions, happy to answer any questions!

So for example, I might want a gmail server to only expose the read tool (but not send, delete etc).<p>I figured if I create a cli for spawning mcp servers, I could intercept the stdin, stdout, stderr etc and modify what the clients see when they are making calls to list tools, resources, and prompts.<p>Well it worked!<p>In the initial version you can easily add a server to claude with a safe list of tools:<p>npx -y mcpgod add @modelcontextprotocol&#x2F;server-everything --client claude --tools=echo,add<p>Now when you load Claude Desktop, it will only discover the echo and add tools from that server. It&#x27;s a nice way to keep the agents in line :)<p>You can check it out here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mcpgod&#x2F;cli\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mcpgod&#x2F;cli</a><p>It will also log everything that a client is doing to ~&#x2F;mcpgod&#x2F;logs.<p>Currently it only has support for claude, but it will be easy to add cursor, cline, windsurf, etc.<p>With the `tools` command you can list all of a servers tools, and even call a tool directly from the command line, which is pretty fun.<p>I was thinking it would be nice to create a UI for it to easily enable&#x2F;disable servers and tools for each client, inspect logs, view analytics, etc.<p>Thanks for reading!",

Now other people can customize the games I make with it.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on canvas language for 15 years now. Not very successful, but editable gifs turned out okay. Since it&#x27;s my passion, I keep trying, and my latest is editable games - I&#x27;m not officially calling it that though.<p>I&#x27;ve had some interest in advergames and this would allow designers to easily customize games for their clients - the hidden objects game being the best example for this, and the only one made specifically for the purpose.<p>Anyways, games are interpreted at runtime by JavaScript. To publish, for example on itch or your own website, you need to submit your project file (download it from the dev studio) and wait a few minutes. You&#x27;ll get back a JS file that contains your game.<p>ngl, although a passion project, I&#x27;d like this to one day be profitable - trying to work that out.<p>If interested, the main project site is <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;canvaslanguage.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;canvaslanguage.com</a><p>I&#x27;d love to get some feedback.

How many customers do you have?<p>2. What&#x27;s expected daily traffic? Peak traffic?<p>3. What database engine or engines do you use?<p>4. How many rows or how much storage does your db have?<p>5.

        "text": "Inspired by Compiler Explorer and other playground&#x2F;fiddle websites like jsfiddle, db-fiddle, Go playground, and Rust playground, I thought it would be cool to have a playground for nearly any program so I&#x27;ve been working on Program Explorer: a playground for running programs from containers. I am inspired by these playgrounds because they are great educational tools for quickly experimenting and as communication tools by sharing shortlinks that reproduce bugs for instance. I would love for every open source project that publishes a container to get their own playground for free.<p>I&#x27;m also interested in the user experience of setupless container execution. Containers have greatly improved program distribution, but serverless container cloud runtimes like Google Cloud Run or AWS Lambda still require transferring the container image, creating an executor, and invoking the executor. These cloud services also come with hardware caps like memory limits where if you need more than that, you&#x27;re back to provisioning a server. I want science researchers for instance to be able to run any computational tool with no setup. Program Explorer is a step in that direction.<p>You choose a container image, set the args, edit the files you want to have at &#x2F;run&#x2F;pe&#x2F;input, then it gets run in a fresh VM and sends back stdout, stderr, and whatever is in &#x2F;run&#x2F;pe&#x2F;output. No network access.<p>You can also set env vars and attach a file as stdin for more control. Most flexibility comes from containers with a shell so that you can write a script to run multiple commands.<p>Currently, you can only pick container images from a predefined list, but suggestions on what to include are welcome. Each run is limited to 1 second (wall clock on a dedicated core) and 1 GB memory as right now the focus is on quick tests&#x2F;demos.<p>The files you send and produce are never written to disk and not stored after your request is complete.<p>MIT licensed at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aconz2&#x2F;program-explorer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aconz2&#x2F;program-explorer</a>. Briefly how it works: container images get packed (ahead of time) into an erofs image, a VM is run with cloud-hypervisor, init process unpacks your files and mounts the rootfs, crun runs the container, then pack your output files and exit code etc. (rusage is in there too if you open the JS console). The server is written as a load balancer using pingora so multiple workers could (eventually) be used, but that is a WIP and currently only has one worker.<p>I have lots of ideas and directions I&#x27;d like to take this but wanted to ship something so others could start playing with it. Looking forward to hearing your ideas and feedback!",

        "text": "Hey HN, after years building some of the core AI and NLU systems in Google Search, we decided to leave and build outside. Our goal was to put the advanced ML and DS techniques we’ve been using in the hands of all software engineers, so that everyone can build AI and Search apps at the same level of performance and sophistication as the big labs.<p>This was a hard technical challenge but we were very inspired by the MVC architecture for Web development. The intuition there was that when a data model changes, its view would get auto-updated. We built a similar architecture for AI. On one side is a scoring system, which encapsulates in a set of metrics what’s good about the AI application. On the other side is a set of optimizers that “compile” against this scorer - prompt optimization, data filtering, synthetic data generation, supervised learning, RL, etc. The scoring system can be calibrated using developer, user or rater feedback, and once it’s updated, all the optimizers get recompiled against it.<p>The result is a setup that makes it easy to incrementally improve the quality of your AI in a tight feedback loop: You update your scorers, they auto-update your optimizers, your app gets better, you see that improvement in interpretable scores, and then you repeat, progressing from simpler to more advanced optimizers and from off-the-shelf to calibrated scorers.<p>We would love your feedback on this approach. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;build.withpi.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;build.withpi.ai</a> has a set of playgrounds to help you quickly build a scorer and multiple optimizers. No sign in required. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.withpi.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.withpi.ai</a> has the API reference and Notebook links. Finally, we have a Loom demo [1].<p><i>More technical details</i><p><i>Scorers:</i> Our scoring system has three key differences from the common LLM-as-a-judge pattern.<p>First, rather than a single label or metric from an LLM judge, our scoring system is represented as a tunable tree of metrics, with 20+ dimensions which get combined into a final (non-linear) weighted score. The tree structure makes scores easily interpretable (just look at the breakdown by dimension), extensible (just add&#x2F;remove a dimension), and adjustable (just re-tune the weights). Training the scoring system with labeled&#x2F;preference data adjusts the weights. You can automate this process with user feedback signals, resulting in a tight feedback loop.<p>Second, our scoring system handles natural language dimensions (great for free-form, qualitative questions requiring NLU) alongside quantitative dimensions (like computations over dates or doc length, which can be provided in Python) in the same tree. When calibrating with your labeled or preference data, the scorer learns how to balance these.<p>Third, for natural language scoring, we use specialized smaller encoder models rather than autoregressive models. Encoders are a natural fit for scoring as they are faster and cheaper to run, easier to fine-tune, and more suitable architecturally (bi-directional attention with regression or classification head) than similar sized decoder models. For example, we can score 20+ dimensions in sub-100ms, making it possible to use scoring everywhere from evaluation to agent orchestration to reward modeling.<p><i>Optimizers:</i> We took the most salient ML techniques and reformulated them as optimizers against our scoring system e.g. for DSPy, the scoring system acts as its validator. For GRPO, the scoring system acts as its reward model. We’re keen to hear the community’s feedback on which techniques to add next.<p>Overall stack: Playgrounds next.js and Vercel. AI: Runpod and GCP for training GPUs, TRL for training algos, ModernBert &amp; Llama as base models. GCP and Azure for 4o and Anthropic calls.<p>We’d love your feedback and perspectives: Our team will be around to answer questions and discuss. If there’s a lot of interest, happy to host a live session!<p>- Achint, co-founder of Pi Labs<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;c09a1fda8cdf4003a5664fa9cfbf7804\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;c09a1fda8cdf4003a5664fa9cfbf7804</a>",
